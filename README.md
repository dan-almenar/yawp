# yawp
### A microblogging webapp developed in Vue.
The main feature of YAWP is its incogni
to essence: while it relies on users have to create an account in order to make posts -each user page will display basic info and stats-, no creator's info is attached to the post in the timeline, meaning people will -if decide to- interact with nothing but the content, either liking or disliking posts.

Some other features are in concept stages, I won't get further into these in case they won't get added.

Beta version is live. You may sign up [here](https://u-yawp.web.app)!

### Languages and tools used to develop the app:
- Vue.
- JavaScript.
- HTML
- CSS

### Note:
Up untill 11/29th the code for this project was on a public repo, yet I set the code repo as private and created this repo to showcase the app as is live.
